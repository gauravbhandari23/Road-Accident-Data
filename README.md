In the road accident data analysis, I used pivot tables and charts to gain insights into key trends and patterns. The pivot tables helped summarize the data, allowing me to identify the distribution of accidents based on various factors such as location, time, and accident severity. I then visualized this data using charts to better understand the frequency and trends across different categories. The charts provided a clear representation of how accidents vary across regions, months, and other parameters, helping to highlight areas needing attention for improved safety measures.
